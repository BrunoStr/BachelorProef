  abstract  = {A VR-based system using a CyberGlove and a Rutgers Master II-ND haptic glove
was used to rehabilitate four post-stroke patients in the chronic phase. Each patient
had to perform a variety of VR exercises to reduce impairments in their finger range
of motion, speed, fractionation and strength. Patients exercised for about two hours
per day, five days a week for three weeks. Results showed that three of the patients
had gains in thumb range (50-140%) and finger speed (10-15%) over the three
weeks trial. All four patients had significant improvement in finger fractionation
(40-118%). Gains in finger strength were modest, due in part to an unexpected
hardware malfunction. Two of the patients were measured against one-month post
intervention and showed good retention. Evaluation using the Jebsen Test of Hand
Function showed a reduction of 23-28% in time completion for two of the patients
(the ones with the higher degrees of impairment). A prehension task was performed
9-40% faster for three of the patients after the intervention illustrating transfer of
their improvement to a functional task.},
